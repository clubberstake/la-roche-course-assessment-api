## Required Software
* To run this program you need a Java IDE that can open and run maven files. I personally use eclipse photon over Jet Brains IDEA because it's lighter weight. I'm assuming you can install this and get it up and running. 
* You will need a MySQL installation version 8 and above.

## Opening the Project
* In your Java IDE, look for the ability to "import a project".
* In those menus, you should be able to pick a "maven" file to import.
* Your IDE may begin installing required projects. This could take time.

## Running the project
* Create a database in MySQL called "capstone"
* First setup your database connection. The Spring JPA project "knows" to look for it in a specific location.
* Create a folder under src > main > "resources".
* In that newly created resources folder create a file called application.properties. In that file add these settings. Make sure there are no spaces at the end of each line!:
   * spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   * spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/capstone
   * spring.datasource.username=root
   * spring.datasource.password=
* Find the main class called "LaRocheChemAssessmentRestfulApp.java" a successful run creates output similar to...
